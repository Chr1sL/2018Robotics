# 2018Robotics

HELLO THIS IS THE ROBOTICS CODING THING FOR 2017-2018

TODO list:
* make everything 10x10x10
* add batteries
* remove tire from clamp
* ask kleindolph how to install battery beneath circuitry and make a power switch to connect to circuitry
* find longer red white black wire
* turn sensors on during first five seconds (so that the sensors don't go 0000 when it turns on)
* add white bottom (close to ground) to the metal so trick other robots
* angle sensors so that they look out ahead of time and don't go near the edge (but numbers might not be as precise)
