# 2018Robotics

HELLO THIS IS THE ROBOTICS CODING THING FOR 2017-2018

TODO list:
* make everything 10x10x10
* add batteries
* remove tire from clamp
* ask kleindolph how to install battery beneath circuitry and make a power switch to connect to circuitry
* find longer red white black wire
* turn sensors on during first five seconds (so that the sensors don't go 0000 when it turns on)

If have time:
* add white bottom (close to ground) to the metal so trick other robots
* angle sensors so that they look out ahead of time and don't go near the edge (but numbers might not be as precise)

Strategies (for coding):
* If see white, turn around or back up?
* If something in front (the other sumoBot), move forward quickly (to push other bot)
* scenario for if we are being pushed? swerve left or right depending on where the edge is?

Be careful with:
* One of the things that can slow your SumoBot down is trying to read too many sensors between servo pulses
